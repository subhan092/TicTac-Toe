# TicToe-game
"Tic Tac Toe is a classic game where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid with their chosen symbol, typically 'X' and 'O'. The goal is to get three of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before your opponent does. This simple web version of Tic Tac Toe uses HTML for the structure, CSS for the design, and JavaScript for the interactive gameplay."
